Id  | Waste Classification  | Description   | Examples |
--- | --------------------- | ------------- | -------- |
D   | Defects               | Incorrect, missing, or unclear information or artifacts. Disrupts the system and adds time/effort needed to resolve. | Broken build / Incorrect configuration / Incorrect requirements |
M   | Manual (HandOffs)     | Overhead, coordination, hadoffs, or other inefficiencies surrounding the setup and execution of work. | Meetings / Manual deployments / Handoffs between teams |
W   | Waiting               | Delays in starting or completing the next value-adding step for a unit of work. | Waiting for approval - change windows / Waiting for resources / Waiting for schedule coordination |
PD  | Partially Done        | Work output that isn't in a complete, usable state (from customer perspective). Often needs input/action from others or further work. Increases defects, task switching, and waiting. | Undeployed and untested code / Incomplete environment setup / Batching within lifecycle |
TS  | Task Switching        | Context switching from partially done work to other work creates waste due to high expense of context switching and greater likelihood of errors. | Unenforced work in progress limits / Interrupts from outages / Cube "drive-bys" - ad-hoc info request |
EP  | Extra Process         | Non-value adding steps or processes that are required (formally or informally) as part of the standard flow of work. | Unnecessary approvals / Unused documentation / "Rubber Stamp" review boards |
EF  | Extra Features        | Features, usually added during implementation, that are not required by or justified by current business needs. Doesn't remove limitation on the business or create customer value. | "Someday we might need..." / Unnecessary upgrade or replacement / Features no one asked for |
H   | Heroics               | Unreasonable burden or extraordinary effort required of someone to successfully complete work or satisfy the customer. | Multi-day firefight-style deployments / Years of tribal knowledge required / Extreme project coordination required |
